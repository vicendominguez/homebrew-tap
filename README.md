# homebrew-vicendominguez

This formula repo provides my personal brew software that I didn't find in [core brew](http://brewformulas.org/)

### How do I install these formulae?

Just `brew tap vicendominguez/tap` and then `brew install <formula>`.

If the formula conflicts with one from Homebrew/homebrew or another tap, you can `brew install vicendominguez/tap/<formula>`.

You can also install via URL:

```
brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vicendominguez/homebrew-tap/master/<formula>.rb
```
