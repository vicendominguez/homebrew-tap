# homebrew-vicendominguez

These formulas provide my personal software I didn't find in [brew](http://brewformulas.org/) formulas

## How do I install these formulae?

Just `brew tap vicendominguez/vicendominguez` and then `brew install <formula>`.

If the formula conflicts with one from Homebrew/homebrew or another tap, you can `brew install vicendominguez/vicendominguez/<formula>`.

You can also install via URL:

```
brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vicendominguez/homebrew-vicendominguez/master/<formula>.rb
```
